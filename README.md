to start app: type 'npm start' on git command line


started utilizing SASS (scss) for style nesting benefits
did this by installing via npm: npm install -g sass, on command line
actual scss file is coming from sass-style.scss and is being compiled to sass-style.css
  to do that, run the command "sass sass-style.scss sass-style.css" on command line
to watch, run the command "sass --watch sass-style.scss sass-style.css" on command line
